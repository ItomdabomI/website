        <section id="habitat">
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>
                Gorillas are found primarily in the dense, tropical forests of Central Africa, including countries like Uganda, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These forests are home to a diverse array of wildlife and provide the ideal environment for gorillas, offering abundant food, shelter, and space to roam. Gorillas primarily live in forested areas, but they also occupy grasslands, swamps, and even bamboo forests. The variety in terrain offers essential resources for gorillas to live comfortably and sustain their diet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The gorilla's habitat is divided into two main types: lowland and mountain habitats. Lowland gorillas live in the relatively flat, lower-altitude forests where the climate is more stable and humid. These areas offer lush vegetation, such as leaves, fruits, and bamboo shoots, which make up the majority of their diet. On the other hand, mountain gorillas inhabit the high-altitude regions of the Virunga Mountains, where the environment is cooler and misty. These gorillas have adapted to the harsh climate by growing thicker fur to keep warm and are often found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the differences between lowland and mountain habitats, both types are essential to the survival of gorilla populations. Lowland gorillas benefit from abundant vegetation and a more moderate climate, while mountain gorillas must navigate steep, rugged terrain, relying on their physical strength and agility. However, these habitats are increasingly under threat due to human activities such as deforestation, mining, and agriculture. As human encroachment continues, gorillasâ€™ access to food and shelter becomes more limited, making it crucial to protect these habitats for the long-term survival of the species.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="diet">
            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>
                Gorillas are primarily herbivores, with their diet consisting mostly of leaves, stems, fruits, and bamboo shoots. They are known to consume a wide variety of plant material, which provides them with the necessary nutrients to thrive. Lowland gorillas, in particular, have access to a wide range of plants in their lush habitat, allowing them to forage for leaves and fruits from trees, shrubs, and vines. In addition to plant matter, gorillas also consume various types of bamboo, which is particularly important for their diet during certain seasons when other food sources may be scarcer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mountain gorillas, while still primarily herbivorous, have a slightly different diet due to the nature of their habitat. The cooler temperatures and mountainous environment provide a unique set of food sources. Mountain gorillas tend to consume more fibrous plant material, such as tree bark, thistles, and a variety of leaves that grow in their high-altitude environment. They also rely heavily on bamboo, which thrives in their mountainous home. Despite the differences in their diets, both lowland and mountain gorillas require a high intake of plant material to meet their dietary needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gorillas are also known to be selective feeders, meaning they will choose the most nutrient-dense parts of plants to consume. They spend a significant amount of time foraging and eating, sometimes consuming up to 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of food per day. Their diet is essential for maintaining their large size and energy levels. Given the extensive amount of food they need to sustain themselves, habitat degradation poses a significant threat to gorillas, as it limits their access to a wide variety of food sources. Conservation efforts must prioritize preserving these critical feeding areas to ensure the long-term survival of gorillas.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="behavior">
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Gorillas are highly social animals, living in groups known as troops, which are typically led by a dominant silverback male. This leader is responsible for making decisions for the group, including where to find food, when to move, and how to protect the group from external threats. The silverback is an important figure in gorilla society, and his strength, wisdom, and leadership ensure the safety and well-being of the group. In addition to the silverback, a typical gorilla troop includes females, their offspring, and sometimes subordinate males.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gorillas communicate with one another through a range of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions. They use vocalizations like grunts, roars, and screams to express a variety of emotions, from warning others of danger to signaling excitement or contentment. Body language, including chest beating, posture, and gestures, is also an essential part of gorilla communication. For example, when a gorilla beats its chest, it can signal dominance or serve as a way to communicate with other members of the troop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gorillas are known for their peaceful nature, but they will defend their group if threatened. They are mostly herbivorous, and their diet leads them to spend much of their time foraging, eating, and resting. Their social structure and behaviors help maintain harmony within the group, as gorillas establish bonds through grooming, playing, and social interactions. Despite their large size and strength, gorillas are gentle and tend to avoid confrontations unless necessary. The social dynamics of gorillas are crucial to their survival, and their complex communication system ensures that they function effectively as a group.

        <section id="conservation">
            <h2>Conservation</h2>
            <p>
                Gorillas face numerous threats, including habitat destruction, poaching, and disease. Deforestation, driven by illegal logging, mining, and agricultural expansion, is a significant issue that leads to the loss of vital habitats for gorillas. As human settlements encroach further into gorilla territories, the available space for these animals continues to shrink. In addition to habitat loss, gorillas are also at risk from poaching, often hunted for bushmeat or captured for the illegal pet trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most serious challenges gorillas face is the risk of disease transmission. Diseases such as Ebola and respiratory infections can decimate gorilla populations, and gorillas are highly susceptible to human-borne illnesses. As humans and gorillas increasingly share overlapping habitats, the likelihood of disease transmission grows, making it important to monitor and protect both human and gorilla health in these regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite these threats, conservation efforts have made a significant impact in recent years. Organizations dedicated to gorilla protection have established protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves, where gorillas can live safely without the threat of poaching or habitat destruction. Additionally, eco-tourism has provided funding for conservation efforts, while raising awareness about the importance of protecting these majestic animals. With continued support for conservation initiatives, there is hope that gorilla populations can recover and thrive in the wild for generations to come.
